# TransformerInGamePurchases

This code was developed as part of the research paper titled "Predictive Analytics of In-game Transactions: Tokenized Player History and Self-Attention Techniques" by Milos A. Kovacevic, Marko D. Pesovic, Zoran Z. Petrovic, and Zoran S. Pucanovic.

The authors would like to thank Mr. Vojislav Milutinovic from the company Two Desperados, whose idea was to form our small research team. Research for this paper was supported by the Linear Algebra and Artificial Intelligence project funded by Algebra AI, Belgrade, Serbia
